# SQL-Projects
SQL code used to create and test a medical database, along with diagrams created to model the database.

Test1.sql, Test2.sql, Test3.sql, Test4.sql, Test5.sql, and TestData.sql are all created by myself.
ERDiagram_Team29.jpeg and ERDiagramMapping_Team29.jpeg were designed by the collective efforts of myself, Sarah Smith, Salma Shire, and Thanmayee Boyapati.
The constraints in Team29.sql were written by Thanmayee Boyapati, the table creations were written by Sarah Smith, and "INSERT INTO" statements were created by myself.
